"<p>Moose is a postmodern object system for Perl 5 that takes the tedium out of writing object-oriented Perl. It borrows all the best features from Perl 6, CLOS (LISP), Smalltalk, Java, BETA, OCaml, Ruby and more, while still keeping true to its Perl 5 roots.</p>"
"<p>Moose is 100% production ready and in heavy use in a number of systems and growing every day. Try it today!</p>"
